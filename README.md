# MESA

MESA is a python package for matching experiment and SOLPS autonomously.
It uses Gaussian-process optimization provided by
[inference-tools](https://github.com/C-bowman/inference-tools)
to maximise agreement between experimental data and SOLPS-ITER
predictions without the need for hand-tuning of SOLPS parameters.
