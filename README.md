# MESA

MESA is a python-based framework for automating the optimisation of
simulation predictions to maximise a user-defined objective. MESA
is designed to be extensible, such that new simulations and optimisation
strategies can be added easily.

The initial goal of development is to autonomously match SOLPS-ITER predictions to
experimental data using Gaussian-process optimisation provided by
[inference-tools](https://github.com/C-bowman/inference-tools).

MESA is still under development - package documentation and example code will be added
as development progresses.
